        My name is Trevor Stam and I’m a <strong>software developer</strong> based in Seattle. I hail from a background
        in <strong>GIS</strong> (geographic
information systems) and <strong>economics</strong>. Although I’m an American citizen, I was born and raised in the
Netherlands.
        I
        worked for several Dutch universities as an economic researcher. Last year I moved to Southern California to
        work in
        GIS and have recently moved up to the Pacific Northwest to establish myself as a developer.
        I steered my career in the direction of application development and away from the static sphere of academic
        publications and advisory reports. I would like to create applications with which users can interact, create
        data
        points or derive insights from.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I started studying geography and urban planning for my love of maps. As a kid I would spend hours leafing
        through
        atlases. I still get carried away and mesmerized at times. I aspire to incorporate my passion for maps as much
        as
        possible in the work that I’m doing. Map-based applications are gaining popularity and location-specific
        information is
        ubiquitous. Maps are visual, relatable, give you good oversight, reference and context. It might be the most
        inclusive
        medium of communicating information.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I work with technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, PostgreSQL, Express, Node.js, Heroku,
        EJS
        and
        Handlebars
        to
        create usable and visually pleasing applications. Furthermore I'm proficient in ArcGIS, QGIS and R. You can find more information about my <strong><a href="projects.html">projects</a></strong>

        and <strong><a href="resume.html">resume</a></strong> on
        this
        site. Feel free to reach out to me or connect with me via my <strong><a href="contact.html">contact
          </a></strong>page.
      </p>

        Next to software development and GIS, I'm an accomplished gypsy and jazz violinist. With my band I played
        semi-professionally across
        Europe. Also I'm an avid cook of all things Asian. I've added various curries to my repertoire and my kimchi is
        fiery
        (as it should be). Another passion is travelling. Experiencing boundlessness and just exploring a completely new
        environment is the most gratifying aspect of it all. My most invigorating travel experiences include Morocco,
        India,
        Indonesia, Japan and driving up the coast from SoCal to Seattle in my raggedy Hyundai.
